        <p>Hey Hannah, <b>thank you</b> for being my friend. I really appreciate all of the music you've shared with me. All of the artists you've put me on to. All of the art you've exposed me to. Now it's time for me to return the favor. I hope you like this site, and I also hope we're friends for a long while. Even if we don't talk everyday I'll always be here for you.</p>
