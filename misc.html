        <p>Hey Hannah, <b>thank you</b> for being my friend. I really appreciate all of the music you've shared with me. All of the artists you've put me on to. All of the art you've exposed me to. Now it's time for me to return the favor. I hope you like this site, and I also hope we're friends for a long while. Even if we don't talk everyday I'll always be here for you.</p>
        <p>Update: Hey Hannah, I'm kinda bad at explaining things or conveying feelings correctly especially over a non personal format like text, but just know that I have an immense ammount of appreication for you. You're one of the nicest funniest people I know. You'll get through this I promise. I know you have the strength, but in saying that its important that you know that you don't have to go through this alone. I'm here for you and I always will be. We'll get through this shit together. Honestly close to tearing up typing this. You mean a lot to me dude. Just wanna see you happy, and I'm sure in time we'll reach that goal. I gotcha buddy.  </p>
